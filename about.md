Welcome to my ENG 7006 student blog/project site. I'm Hassan (pronounced huss-un)!. I enjoy listening to the sounds of wild pheasants in my neighborhood, wandering Bell Isle park, trying to read Baudrillard, listening to crust punk music. Check back for updates to this page!

This site is based on the [*folio Jekyll theme by bogoli](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio).
