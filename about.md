Welcome to my ENG 7006 student blog/project site. I'm Hassan (pronounced huss-un)!. I enjoy listening to the sounds of the wild pheasants in my neighborhood, wandering Bell Isle park, and trying to read Baudrillard. Updates to this page coming soon!

This site is based on the [*folio Jekyll theme by bogoli](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio).
