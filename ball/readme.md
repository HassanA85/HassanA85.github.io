# Ball daily

As I mentioned in class last night, there are only three dailies this week. Refactor one of your sketches from last week so that it is more readable, using variables, and possibly objects.

The other two dailies are related to Ball:
* Modify the code in this repo so that the ball bounces horizontally
* Modify the code in this repo so that it bounces vertically

As an extra assignment, you may wish to make it so that the ball bounces in both directions at once. (We will do that in lab next week.)

To help you understand what's at issue in this assignment, please consult [Coding Lesson 2](https://github.com/ENG7006/coding-lessons/blob/master/coding-lesson-2.md).

To help you get setup downloading and modifying code, please consult [GitHub Workflow instructions](https://github.com/eng7006/github-workflow).

If you have any questions, undue difficulties, or are stuck getting started, please post to the #tech channel in the course Slack site.
