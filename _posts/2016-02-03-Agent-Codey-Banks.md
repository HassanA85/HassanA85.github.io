I don't have much to report here, seeing as I am drastically behind on my dailies. I hope to remedy that tomorrow. I do, on the hand, have some interesting sketches up and running. By practicing functions, I was able to achieve a sun set! I learned that built-in functions such as "background" are themselves up for manipulation. By presetting RGB values for my background, and then creating a separate function for *drawing* the background, I was able to simultaneously run a yellow, vertically moving ellipse (the sun), with the decreasing color values for my background (the sky). The result is a moving, bucolic scene to rival Thomas Kinkade himself! I'm not sure that I can host java code here, and am still hesitant to create a new repositories for my sketches, but I would love to show my sketch to anyone interested.

I should be more frustrated with the snail-pace at which I am learning code, but things continue to make sense. I am keen on attending coding meet ups, and talking to others about their own coding practices. After reading Kittler this week, I imagine our forays into code as being similar to early printing and the automization of text and information transfer. There's something appealing about building from the ground-up, especially since the novelty is still quiet fresh for me. I can see the aesthetic possibilities that can come from making and moving objects in rigid, simple ways, not to mention the excitement of being in a type of digital arts class. I really (really) hope to finish refraction and bounce this weekend...
